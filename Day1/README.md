## Getting Started with Cloud Operations Lab  
This hands-on lab guides you through the steps to estimate Amazon Web Services (AWS) costs for a sample workload. The workload that you evaluate is for a three-tier web application that consists of :  
+       An Application Load Balancer  
+       An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance  
+       An Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance 

The skills will help you to use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs for your workloads.
