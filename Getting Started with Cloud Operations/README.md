## Getting Started with Cloud Operations Lab  
This hands-on lab guides you through the steps to estimate Amazon Web Services (AWS) costs for a sample workload. The workload that you evaluate is for a three-tier web application that consists of :  
+       An Application Load Balancer  
+       An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance  
+       An Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance 

The skills will help you to use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs for your workloads.

###     Introduction to the Well-Architected Framework
<b>Cloud Environment</b>

+   Security
+   Operation
+   Performance
+   Scalability
+   Cost


### What is cloud operations?
+   Innovation
+   Cost
+   Compliance
+   Security


### Benefits of Cloud Operations
+       Innovation
    AWS helps you use the cloud to turn ideas into opportunities, creating new ways to grow, increase efficiency, and serve customers better. AWS has industry leading cloud services to help customers solve problems and explore possibilities.

+       Scale
    AWS management and governance services are built to manage highly dynamic cloud resources at massive scale.

+       Simplicity
    AWS reduces complexity, offering a single control plane for customers to manage and govern their resources on AWS and on-premises.

+       Cost savings
    Customers can use AWS management and governance services to assess their resource utilization and identify ways to reduce costs.

### AWS WA Framework: six pillars
+       Operational excellence
    The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.
    
+       Security
    The security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.

+       Reliability
    The relaibility pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended function and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.

+       Performance efficiency
    This pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business need evolve.

+       Cost optimization
    The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
+       Sustainability












## LAB:
### Getting Started with Cost Estimation
#### 1. AWS Pricing Calculator
+ Launch [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) and begin to <strong>Create an estimate.</strong>
