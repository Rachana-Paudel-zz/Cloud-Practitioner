## Getting Started with Cloud Operations Lab  
This hands-on lab guides you through the steps to estimate Amazon Web Services (AWS) costs for a sample workload. The workload that you evaluate is for a three-tier web application that consists of :  
+       An Application Load Balancer  
+       An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance  
+       An Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance 

The skills will help you to use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs for your workloads.

## LAB:
### Getting Started with Cost Estimation
#### 1. AWS Pricing Calculator

#### 3. Review and download the estimate

+   <b><u>Choose View summary.</u></b>  
    a.  Review the overall costs that AWS Pricing Calculator generated for the services from the My Estimate page. enter `Review Summary` and configure it. <small><u><i>[Learn to configure](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/889/modules/items/15053)</i></u></small>.
