##  Introduction to Cloud 101

### Module 1
#####   Why learn about the cloud

+   Demand for cloud skills is increasing
+   Cloud computing skills are relevant for all IT professionals
+   Cloud certification validates knowledge and skills

### Module2
#####   Objectives
+   Define cloud computing
+   Describe the basics of cloud computing
+   Discuss the benefits of cloud computing
+   Identify cloud service models and cloud deployment models

#####   Why cloud computing?
+   It assests as programmatic resources to quickly set up and tear doen resources
+  Access resources dynamically for agility and flexibility to meet customer needs
+   Pay-as-you-go to test and use the system without being fully commited

#####   Client Server model
Model computing is based on the client-server model
+   A client can be web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.
+   A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

##### Six benefis of cloud computing

1. Trade upfront expense for variable expense
2. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Benefit from massice economies of scale
5. Increase speed and agility
6. Go global in minutes

#####   Deploying to the cloud
Cloud service and deployment methods provide different levels of control, flexibility and management.

Deployment method include
+   `Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)`: IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers(Virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a servive provides the highest levl of flexibility and management cinrol over your IT resources.
+   `Platform as a service (Paas)`: Itremoves the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure. They can focus on the deployment and management of applications. These tools give developers the ability to be more efficient because they dont need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planing, software maintenance, and patching

+`   Software as a service(Saas)`: It is a completed software product that the service provider runs and manages. With a SaaS offering, you donot have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. Yu only must think about how you wil use that particular piece of software.

Deplyoment(models) strategies include
+   <u>Cloud</u>: you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new application in the cloud. You can build hose application on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them by using higher-level services tha reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.

+   <u>Hybrid</u>: In this, cloud-based resources are conneced to on-premises infrastructure. You can integrate cloud-based resources wih legacy IT application. You migh want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy appliacations that are better maintained on premises, or goverment regulations require your bussiness o keep certain records on premises.
+  <u> On-premises</u>: It is also known as private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virualization and resource management tools, Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualizatuon technologies.
