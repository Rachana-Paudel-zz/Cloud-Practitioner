####	3.	Introduction to Networking
Computer network is two or more devices connected together to share resources. 
Devices on network are called nodes. Nodes on network are divided into two categories are
i.	Host node
Centralized node that shares files, applications, and resources with other nodes on the network

+	File Servers
+	Email Servers
+	Web Servers

ii.	Client node
Nodes that depend on the host node for files, applications, and resources
Examples
+	Computers
+	Printers
+	Mobile devices
