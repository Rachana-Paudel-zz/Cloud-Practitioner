####	3.	Introduction to Networking
Computer network is two or more devices connected together to share resources. 
Devices on network are called nodes. Nodes on network are divided into two categories are
i.	Host node
Centralized node that shares files, applications, and resources with other nodes on the network
Examples:
+	File Servers
+	Email Servers
+	Web Servers

ii.	Client node
Nodes that depend on the host node for files, applications, and resources
Examples
+	Computers
+	Printers
+	Mobile devices

####    Network Components
+       Server
    A sever is a physical computer that runs software services that other computer devices or software can access. Servers are distinguished by the service that they provide. Common use cases for servers include the following:
    +   Web servers: stores and distributes web pages and other web content by using HTTP
    +   File server:    Stores and distributes files
    +   Database server: Stores databases and manages access to the databases
    +   Prin server: Controls and manages one or more remote printers on the network
    +   Mail server: Stores and delivers email, like a digital post office
    +   Proxy server: Improves security by acting as an intermediary ror requests from clients that are seeking resources

    
+       Router
    A router is a network device that connects multiple network segments into one network. It is located at any gateway. The router connects multiple switeched and theru respective networks to enable communicatuon between the different networks. It acts as a switch between neworks and can also filter the data tha flows through it. As soon as the router is connected, it can make intelligent decisions about how best to get network data to its destination. It nases tjese decisions on network performance data tha it gathers from the network itself.

+       Internet services provider
    It is an organization that provides internet access to its customers. Without the services that an ISP offers, you would no be able to access other networks on the internet.

+       Cloud
    It is on-demand delievery of IT resources over the interne. You don't need to buy, own, and maintain physical data centers and servers. Instead, you can access technology services, such as servers, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from cloud provider like AWS.
