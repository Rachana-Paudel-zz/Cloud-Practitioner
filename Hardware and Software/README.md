### Hardware
Computer hardware consists of the physical components that make up a computer system.

### Software
Computer software consists of the computer programs and related data that provide the instructions for telling the computer hardware and software.

Hardware and software have a special relationship with each other. For a computer to produce useful output, its hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be produced with the hardware on its own, and the software cannot be used without hardware to support it.
